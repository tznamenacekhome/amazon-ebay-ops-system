## Purchases Frontend Uses Component + Hook Boundaries

Decision:
Keep the purchases page as a composition layer and move reusable UI and derived logic into web/app/purchases.

Current structure:
- page.tsx composes the workspace
- usePurchases owns loading, API mutations, save state, and error state
- usePurchaseFilters owns filter state and filtered rows
- purchaseStats computes dashboard metrics
- PurchasesTable, PurchaseDetailDrawer, EditablePriceCell, PurchaseFilters, and PurchaseMetrics own focused UI sections

Reason:
The previous page.tsx monolith increased maintenance risk, truncation risk, and regression risk during AI-assisted edits.

Rule:
Do not place landed cost calculations, matching logic, or receiving workflow behavior in the purchases frontend.
